If you already use an ‘open’ booking system it’s as easy as ticking a box. If your booking system isn’t already open, get in touch with us and we can link you up with other organisations who want the same booking system to open their data.

If you’re not using a booking system, you can get straight to work getting your data to match the community standard.
