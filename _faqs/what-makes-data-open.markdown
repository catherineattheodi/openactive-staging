[Open data](https://theodi.org/guides/what-open-data){: target="_blank"} is data that anyone can access, use and share.
Open data has to have a licence that says it is open data. Without a licence, the data canâ€™t be reused. The licence might also say:

* That people who use the data must credit whoever is publishing it (this is called attribution)
* That people who mix the data with other data have to also release the results as open data (this is called share-alike)
