OpenActive data is ‘open opportunity data’ about sports opportunities. By making this openly available, more people will be able to find out about local opportunities, and this will make getting active easier. [OpenActive e-learning modules](https://www.openactive.io/e-learning) will take you through what ‘open opportunity data’ is and why it is important.
