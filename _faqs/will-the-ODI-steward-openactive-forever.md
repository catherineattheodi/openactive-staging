No. In order for the initiative to become a success, it needs to be self-sustaining and driven by the sector itself. The ODI aims to provide the knowledge, tools and foundation for ‘open opportunity data’ to thrive independently. Beyond its stewardship role, the ODI will continue to play a collaborative role as an active OpenActive member.

Through lottery funding awarded by Sport England, the ODI stewards the initiative: driving engagement across the sector, building data literacy, collaboratively developing open data standards, stimulating innovation with startups and leading the initiative’s events and communications. The current funding phase runs from August 2017 to November 2018.

With this future in mind, all tools, documentation and materials have been built by the ODI and OpenActive members with community-led sustainability and maintenance in mind.
