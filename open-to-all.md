#### Openness is integral to the OpenActive initiative

The assets we produce, (standards, training, tools), and the data we publish are openly licensed, making them free for anyone to access, use or share.

The community is open for anyone to join as we believe it's the best way to create a robust data infrastructure, while ensuring people embrace this change in a sustainable way.

#### OpenActive is stewarded by the Open Data Institute

The [Open Data Institute (ODI)](http://theodi.org) is a not-for-profit organisation that was co-founded in 2012 by the inventor of the web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, and AI expert Sir Nigel Shadbolt, to address today’s global challenges using the web of data.
The ODI's responsibility as stewards of  OpenActive is to co-ordinate the development of the data standards, grow the community, and help organisations publish and use [open opportunity data](https://beta.openactive.io/how-it-works/). We receive National Lottery funding from Sport England, obliging the ODI to manage the initiative to benefit the whole community above a single commercial entity.
The ODI's role is to build a community that is fair for everyone.
