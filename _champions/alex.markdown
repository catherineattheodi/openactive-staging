Alex is responsible for shaping London Sport’s strategic commitments to supporting technology, data and digital initiatives designed to raise levels of participation in physical activity and sport in the capital. This includes shaping the strategic design and implementation of the Sport Tech Hub, OpenActive and leading London’s plan of action in ‘Making London the Heart of the Sport Tech World’.

>“As an early advocate and supporter of the OpenActive initiative, leading to the opening of data from some of the early activity providers, I am keen to pass on the learnings and experiences gained so the right foundations can be implemented in other parts of the country.”
>“I’m most excited about supporting the growth of OpenActive beyond London by working with the remaining OpenActive Champions.”
