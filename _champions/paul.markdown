Paul leads on all things involving data and technology for England Squash, as well as overseeing the production and application of insight and marketing all programmes and activities.

> I aim to start the conversation with data owners about the impact they can have on the wider sector, and to demonstrate the benefits of doing so for the sector as a whole. I’m aiming to network, listen and learn a lot from my peers about their experiences in order to enrich our own knowledge and improve the way we all work — hopefully some of my perspectives and experiences I can pass on will also improve what and how the other champions do things too.\
>
> I also want it to be a catalyst for England Squash to identify and release some data sources we can release as open data!\
>
> I’m excited to be at the heart of a movement that will hopefully see the sport and physical activity sector embrace technology and data and produce a step change in the way we all get active in this country!
