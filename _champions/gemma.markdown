> I’m committed to helping to bring change to the sector in our area. As part of Active Sussex we aim to raise the profile of open data via our ongoing stakeholder engagement and specifically through the Intelligence Programme to ensure partners understand both programmes.
>
> I feel if we can change the perceptions around data and help partners understand the wider benefits, it will not only help them as organisations to increase their reach and potential targeting, but will also ensure more people are able to find the opportunities and experiences that are right for their needs easily and quickly.
>
> I’m most looking forward to both developing practical solutions based on the needs of partners and learning from best practice and also connecting with data experts and building new partnerships.
