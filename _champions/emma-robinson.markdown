Emma manages and coordinates research and evaluation activities and impact measurement for Yorkshire Sport Foundation.
> “I’m really interested in how we can use open data to drive innovation in the sport and physical activity sector, and ultimately get more people active across Yorkshire. For me, this is about how we bring in our whole sphere of partners from Local Authority facility providers to community organisations and activators in some of our most inactive communities.
> “I’m excited to progress how we have that open data conversation locally and provide solutions that will improve both choice and access to opportunities for individuals in our region.”
