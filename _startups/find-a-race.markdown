As the endurance sport market continues to grow, more people are taking part in mass participation events than ever before. But there are two problems: athletes can't find events to take part in and race organisers can't reach athletes.

[findarace.com](mailto:hello@findarace.com) connects people looking for their next goal with the thousands of mass participation sports events that take place every year. We provide a two-way service that helps athletes find events and event organisers reach athletes.

We believe setting a clear goal is an effective way of raising levels of physical activity. findarace.com makes it easy to find and enter a race that interests you, and nothing provides the essential motivation like having a race in the diary.

**Why they’re excited:** We are really excited to be part of a talented group of people looking to support the drive towards open data within the industry, and we’re looking forward to realising the huge potential that this opens for us as a business.
