# Data aggregation to drive a more active nation

[imin](https://www.imin.co/) is a social good technology company, which provides open data aggregation products for organisations tasked with helping people live a more active lifestyle.

In sectors where open data is published by multiple data sources, people who want to use data to solve challenges and build products must find and access good quality data. Data aggregators offer services to make this easier. They provide expertise to locate relevant data sources, improve its quality and bring them together in one place, saving time. In addition, they provide services that help their customers manage data with user-friendly interfaces.

In the transport sector, aggregators like [Transport API](https://www.transportapi.com/) homogenise and augment transport data from multiple sources into a single technology platform. Aggregating this open data from sources like [National Rail Enquiries](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/) and [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/) allows other innovators such as [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/), [Heathrow](https://www.transportapi.com/showcase/heathrow-airport/) or perviously [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/) to simplify the data-gathering process and focus on using the available data to [power or enrich their services](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/10NIjyeYitZC5BVi1Ol2bjArfgoFnwM-PwRbO-vDjo6I/edit#heading=h.q8w5u82pr7kn).

Aggregators help encourage the use of open data by creating a single access point with additional support for users. They often build relationships with publishers and data users to meet their varying needs. By making more data available and enabling data users to focus on developing products, aggregators enable rapid innovation.

A sector where data aggregation has propelled better product and service innovation is the travel sector. Aggregators like [Amadeus](http://www.amadeus.com/web/amadeus/en_GB-GB/Amadeus-Home/1319477346985-Page-AMAD_HomePpal) and [Travelport](https://www.travelport.com/)enable websites like [Hotels.com](https://www.hotels.com/) and [Expedia](https://www.expedia.co.uk/) to offer seamless holiday comparison and booking. By working with insurance companies, airports, airlines and hotels, these aggregators enable data users to create personalised travel experiences for holidaymakers.

## **Facts and figures**

**Going digital requires data too**

‘[Open opportunity data](https://beta.openactive.io/FAQ)’ is data about where and when sport and physical activities happen. It includes details such as location, time, cost, and ability that help people decide whether to try out an activity. The data is openly available for anyone to access, use and share.

Publishing this data openly is new for the sector as it’s often contained internally in spreadsheets or booking systems, PDFs or flyers. Siloing this information makes it harder for people searching for activities — it’s difficult to find and not always up to date.

In 2015, when imin first began convincing the sector to publish open data, many organisations were keen to ‘go digital’. However, the steps required to get there were unexplored and imin received skepticism about both the role of open data and the value imin could bring. The sector was also reserved about the success of the travel sector and parallels of opportunity. With awarded grant funding from Innovate UK and the European Commission, imin researched the role of open data in the sector, later establishing the [OpenActive initiative](https://medium.com/@domfennell/open-for-one-open-for-all-9aaea4340016) with London Sport.

**Sharing expertise in the sector**

Working closely with sector early adopters to understand their needs, imin developed a platform which aggregates open opportunity data across the sector. imin’s platform and data augmentation services provide organisations with high quality data to use in any way they choose. This removes the technical process of using open data directly from the source, offering a timely solution for organisations that meets their needs over building the capabilities internally.

With open data still a relatively new concept within the sector, there is a longer-term need to build data literacy in order to empower the sector to independently publish and use open data. Data aggregators, like imin, can encourage and facilitate the opening up and use of open data, to make it easier for the sector to embrace this change. Taking this position supports imin’s core business value to improve the supply of open data for innovators, in order to help people get active.

Simultaneously, the ODI is developing these skills with organisations through training and supporting local [OpenActive Champions](https://blog.openactive.io/openactive-champions-assemble-10-advocates-embrace-local-transformation-with-open-data-to-get-fe71c953fd31). Enabling organisations to choose what is right for them supports wider adoption of open data.

For example, imin helped the [London Borough of Hounslow](https://www.activechoice.org/stories/hounslow-makes-an-activechoice) to partner with [Played](http://www.playedsports.co.uk/), a tech company tasked with building a new One You Hounslow activity finder with a public health focus. The borough found Played through [active//choice](https://www.activechoice.org/categories) — a platform built by imin in association with London Sport — produced to help local authorities, sports bodies and the private sector to learn about the products on offer within the sector.

imin hopes active//choice will help organisations make informed decisions about what products they can use and purchase.

In September 2017, UK-based leisure operator [Fusion Lifestyle](http://www.imin.co/posts/fusion-lifestyle-and-imin-usher-in-new-era-for-sector) also collaborated with imin to make their physical activity classes available to book within third party websites and applications. Fusion published its open opportunity data through the OpenActive initiative earlier that year.

Former Sports and Partnerships Group Manager at Fusion Lifestyle, Francois Smit said,

> *“As a pioneering leisure operator, we are always striving to keep Fusion ahead of the curve. By working with imin, we’ve done just that: now our activities can be booked anywhere across the web. It’s groundbreaking for the leisure sector and we’re excited to be making it happen.”*

## Growth through collaboration
As a small startup operating in a sector with large public and private organisations, imin identified early on that collaboration would be crucial to succeed with its open data approach. By forming strong relationships with public sector organisations, the team was able to drive the open data agenda with a public health and societal development focus, while growing its network of like-minded startups seeking to disrupt the sector.

The company maintains that if the physical activity sector collectively changes the way it collaborates and shares data, it can get more people more active. It is thanks to this collaborative approach that imin has continued to support the OpenActive initiative to open data across the country.

“When we aligned ourselves with something bigger than our commercial ambitions, people really began listening” said Nishal Desai, Co-founder of imin.

## What’s next?
imin is making it easier for other organisations to use open data. The company foresees that the data it aggregates and augments will support new technology devices such as increasingly popular chatbots like Amazon Echo or Google Home: “Hey Google, book me a squash court in Brixton tonight at 7pm”. They believe that, thanks to the open data infrastructure now in place, a world of previously unimaginable ways to access physical activity is just around the corner.

The company’s current focus is enabling the seamless booking of activities from any customer-facing interface. Having worked to transform the search experience in the sport and physical activity sector, the team want to facilitate the ‘one-click booking’ model seen in other industries. The team are currently exploring this with global sports brands, corporate wellness organisations and governing bodies of sport. Nishal continues,

> “We’re at the tip of the iceberg, and are wildly excited about what’s to come.”
